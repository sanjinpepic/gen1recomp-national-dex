# Changelog

Format: [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Version headings match `manifest.json`'s `version`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `tests/national_dex_test.lua`, which loads the mod through the headless
  loader with the dex switched on and asserts what it registers: the
  1025-species roster, Charizard's megas reporting No. 006 rather than the
  synthetic keys they register under, the DARK row a Gen 1 chart cannot
  express, and the deep-copy guarantee the export API promises callers.
  Writing it turned up that three matchups never take: `content.type_chart`
  `:register` refuses an id the engine registered first, so GHOST>PSYCHIC,
  POISON>BUG and BUG>POISON keep their Gen 1 values and the modern chart
  really lands in 321 of its 324 rows. The suite pins them as they behave, so
  correcting the registration will fail it and name what moved.
- `mod.card` carries the full sharing schema — tags, the `differences`
  tri-ledger, credit to PokeAPI for the species data, and a `compat` range.

### Changed

- `mod.card.author` names `sanjinpepic`. 0.8.0 shipped the card under a
  different handle, and the author is what the manager and the showcase both
  surface.
- `manifest.category` is now `CONTENT`. `GAMEPLAY` is a grandfathered alias
  for `TWEAK`, which means small data edits; a mod that registers 1025
  species and 326 forms was being filed, sorted and searched as a numbers
  tweak in both the gallery and the manager.

## 0.8.0

### Added

- Species 1–1025: names, dex entries, typing, base stats, level-up
  learnsets, evolutions, growth rates and catch rates.
- The modern 18-type chart — 324 matchups, and the DARK, STEEL and FAIRY
  types a national-dex roster cannot be typed without.
- 326 alternate forms (megas, gigantamax, regional variants) nested inside
  their base species. Mega Charizard X and Y are both No. 006, as in the
  real games, rather than taking dex rows of their own.
- Sp.Atk and Sp.Def carried alongside the ROM's single collapsed Special
  stat rather than replacing it, so the engine's damage maths is untouched.
- A Pokédex STATS page with left/right form browsing, and the same split on
  the party summary screen.
- `apiVersion`, `statsByDex`, `statsBySpecies`, `listSpecies`, `formsOf`,
  `splitStats` and `hasSplitStats` on `mod.exports`, for mods built on this
  data — a battle engine being the first expected consumer.
- `NATIONAL DEX`, `TYPE CHART` and `STATS` options, each defaulting to the
  vanilla behaviour so enabling the mod changes nothing until asked.
