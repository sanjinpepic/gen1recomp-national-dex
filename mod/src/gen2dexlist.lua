-- Gold's #DEX: the beyond-251 species in the listing, and alternate-form
-- browsing on the entry screen.
--
-- Why this file exists at all, and why none of it is a constant patch:
--
-- On Gen 1 the listing's length is a constant.  src/ui/PokedexMenu.lua:26
-- walks `for n = 1, constants.dexSize or 151`, so src/nationaldex.lua's
-- mod.content.constants:patch("dexSize", ...) is the whole feature.  Neither
-- half of that holds on Gold:
--
--   * The patch does not land where Gen 1's does.  src/mods/Schemas.lua:485
--     routes the `constants` registry to `gen2Constants` on a Gen 2 boot, so
--     the write reaches data.gen2Constants.dexSize instead of
--     data.constants.dexSize.  `dexSize` is not among R.constants.gen2Keys
--     either (Schemas.lua:1866-1882 -- that catalog is the ordered ROM lists
--     plus a fixed handful), so it merges as a mod's own unrecognised key.
--     No error is raised and nothing reads it back: the patch succeeds and
--     means nothing.
--   * Even landing it in data.constants would change nothing, because Gold's
--     screen never reads dexSize.  src/ui/gen2/PokedexMenu.lua sizes its list
--     from the ROM's own dex table: :order() (line 244) and :rebuild() (257)
--     build self.rows out of data.gen2Pokedex.entries, and a species with no
--     entry there is skipped outright (line 264, `if entry then`).
--
-- And data.gen2Pokedex has no registry pointing at it -- it is loaded straight
-- from the ROM cache in src/core/Game2.lua:879 and appears nowhere in
-- Schemas.GEN2.  There is therefore no sanctioned content route to widen
-- Gold's dex, which is what leaves an in-memory patch of Gold's own class as
-- the only seam, the same technique src/dexpage.lua uses on Gen 1.
--
-- The class is reached by its REAL name.  A mod's require is not redirected on
-- a Gold boot -- both generations ship in one archive, so
-- require("src.ui.PokedexMenu") would hand back Gen 1's class here and this
-- file would patch something Gold never draws.  Nothing below chooses its
-- behaviour by probing which methods exist, for the same reason: that probe
-- answers "yes" on the wrong class.  M.install refuses to run at all unless
-- the caller says generation 2.
--
-- Everything above M.install is pure -- no love, no engine module, no mod
-- handle -- so tests exercise it with plain tables.  M.spriteArt, the last of
-- them, holds to that at file scope and reaches for one engine module only
-- from inside the closure it returns, once a draw has actually asked.
--
-- The pic is the second thing Gold's dex resolves for itself and never asks
-- about: see M.spriteArt for why the sprite mod cannot reach this screen, and
-- the drawPic patch for why the art also has to be drawn here rather than
-- handed back to the cart's own draw.
--
-- The third arm is the two actions this mod adds to the entry screen's action
-- bar and the pages behind them: STAT, the Gen 2 counterpart of the Gen 1
-- STATS page, and LVL, the species' evolution line and the moves it learns by
-- levelling.  Its own section below carries the measurements that decide how a
-- fifth and a sixth word fit on a row that was already full, and why the bar
-- scrolls rather than being respelled.
--
-- Why they are BAR SLOTS rather than Gen 1's walk-down-a-strip: on this game
-- UP and DOWN are already spoken for on the entry screen -- they cycle a
-- species' alternate forms, which is the arm above -- and LEFT/RIGHT are the
-- cart's own action bar.  There is no direction left to enter a strip with
-- that is not being taken off something a player already uses.  The bar is
-- the screen's own way of offering another page, so the pages are offered
-- there; the WALKING survives inside the LVL view, where UP and DOWN are free
-- and page it exactly as the Gen 1 strip pages.

-- rewindowed the listing (or a widescreen mode that showed more of it) would
-- leave the page jump stepping by the old size with nothing anywhere saying
-- so.  :ensureVisible scrolls exactly far enough to bring `index` into view
-- (PokedexMenu.lua:278-286), so a probe placed far down a long list comes back
-- with scroll = index - VISIBLE_ROWS and the window size falls out of the
-- subtraction.
--
-- The probe is a plain table because that method reads index, scroll and rows
-- and touches nothing else, which is also what keeps this half of the file
-- free of the engine.

-- ------------------------------------------------------- the STATS action
--
-- Gold's entry screen ends in an action bar the player walks with LEFT/RIGHT
-- (src/ui/gen2/PokedexMenu.lua:333-336), and the fifth entry added to it here
-- is this mod's Gen 2 counterpart of the Gen 1 STATS page (src/dexpage.lua).
-- The bar is drawn as ONE string at tile column 1 of row 17, with the arrow
-- parked in the blank cell in FRONT of the selected word (the cart's own
-- ENTRY_ACTION_X = { 1, 6, 11, 15 } are exactly those cells), so a slot costs
-- one cell for the arrow plus one per letter.
--
-- The row is already full, and that is measured rather than assumed.  The
-- entry screen draws under G.translate(-SCX, 0) with SCX = 5
-- (PokedexMenu.lua:903); the font cell is a fixed 8 pixels
-- (src/render/Font.lua's GLYPH advance, which Font.advanceOf returns for every
-- ROM font page); and the cart's " PAGE AREA CRY PRNT" is 19 cells drawn at
-- column 1, so it runs from x = 1*8 - 5 = 3 to x = 155 on a 160-pixel screen.
-- Three pixels spare on the left, five on the right.  A twentieth cell would
-- end at 163, and this screen has no scissor -- PokedexMenu:drawWidescreen
-- scales drawPanel straight into the window -- so it would print OUTSIDE the
-- console frame rather than being clipped.
--
-- 19 cells is therefore the entire budget, and the four words with their four
-- arrow cells already spend all of it: (1+4)+(1+4)+(1+3)+(1+4) = 19.  Adding
-- " STAT" asks for 24.  No abbreviation rescues that -- five slots need five
-- arrow cells, which leaves 14 cells for five words, so even five three-letter
-- labels overflow by one.
--
-- So the bar SCROLLS, which is this screen's own answer to a list that does
-- not fit: the listing beside it shows seven of its rows and moves the window
-- to keep the cursor on screen.  Four slots are shown and the window moves
-- only when the arrow reaches the fifth, so the bar is the cart's own
-- " PAGE AREA CRY PRNT" -- character for character, arrow column for arrow
-- column -- on four of the five positions, and reads " AREA CRY PRNT STAT"
-- only while the new action is selected.
--
-- STAT and not STATS, because BOTH windows have to fit the same 19 cells: the
-- second one measures (1+4)+(1+3)+(1+4)+(1+N) = 15 + N, so the new word gets
-- four letters and a fifth would push it off the screen.
--
-- A SIXTH slot -- LVL, the evolution line and the level-up learnset -- adds a
-- third window and no new problem, because the window is what pays for it.
-- The three the bar can show now measure:
--
--   slots 1-4  " PAGE AREA CRY PRNT"  (1+4)+(1+4)+(1+3)+(1+4) = 19
--   slot  5    " AREA CRY PRNT STAT"  (1+4)+(1+3)+(1+4)+(1+4) = 19
--   slot  6    " CRY PRNT STAT LVL"   (1+3)+(1+4)+(1+4)+(1+3) = 18
--
-- So the widest is still the cart's own row and nothing new can overflow it.
-- The third window being SHORT is the one thing the sixth slot really
-- changed, and it is not cosmetic: the cart clears 18 columns and lets its
-- own 19-cell string cover the nineteenth, so a window that stops at 18 would
-- leave the "T" of the cart's PRNT standing in that last cell.  See
-- drawActionBar, which clears the row's whole width for that reason.
--
-- LVL and not MOVES or LEVEL, for the same measurement: at (1+5) the third
-- window is 20 cells and prints off the side of the console.

-- The engine's own four in its own order (PokedexMenu.lua:51), and ours after
-- them.  That order is load bearing rather than cosmetic: A on slots 1-4 is
-- dispatched by the ENGINE's own branch off this very index, so a bar that
-- listed them in another order would fire the wrong action.

-- read, and leaving them out is what keeps this view four pages at its worst
-- instead of twenty.
--
-- Evolutions come FIRST for the reason Gen 1 puts them first: the level-up
-- list is the long one, and a player opening this to see what a mon becomes
-- must not have to page through its moves to get there.
--
-- The geometry is the STATS page's own box -- 16 interior rows by 18 interior
-- columns, every row a bordered box fits on Gold's 18-row screen -- with a
-- title row and the rule under it spent on the header, exactly as the entry
-- screen and the STATS page spend theirs.  That leaves 14 rows for content,

-- ------------------------------------------------- the sprite mod's art

-- The id of the neighbour this asks, and the export it asks through.

-- Gold's dex draws the CART's pic and offers no seam to change it:
-- src/ui/gen2/PokedexMenu.lua:400 reads record.spriteFront through
-- Assets.image and raises no hook, which is why a sprite mod cannot reach
-- this screen from its own side and why the reach has to be made from here.
--
-- Returns a resolver -- (pokemon, speciesId, data, mon) -> path, trueColor --
-- or nil when there is nothing to ask.  The whole integration is OPTIONAL: no
-- neighbour, a disabled one, or one with no art for a species all answer nil
-- and Gold's own pic is drawn exactly as before.
--
-- `mon` is a LIVE mon table where the caller has one (the party summary does,
-- the dex does not) and nil otherwise.  The registry reads shininess off its
-- DVs (dev/src/registry.lua:139), which is the only way a shiny gets its own
-- art; dev/src/compat_monpic.lua:169 hands the battler's mon over for exactly
-- that reason.  A species with no shiny variant falls through to the plain
-- front, so passing it can only add art, never lose it.
--
-- TWO questions are asked, of two different places, because neither can
-- answer the other's:
--
--   * WHETHER, and WHICH art -- universal_sprites' own `resolveSprite`
--     export (dev/src/api.lua), the same activeRegistry():resolve call its
--     battle path makes.  nil means "we have nothing for this species", and
--     it is the only lookup that can say so: the engine's Sprites.path hands
--     back the vanilla path in that case, which is indistinguishable from a
--     mod answering with art that happens to be the cart's.
--   * HOW to draw it -- the trueColor flag off the engine's own
--     pokemon.sprite seam, which is where the sprite mod publishes its RENDER
--     STYLE decision (a four-shade NATIVE set answers false and MUST keep the
--     GBC palette; full-colour art answers true and must not).  No export
--     carries that, and guessing it wrong is visible either way round: a
--     shaded full-colour pic, or a grey one.
--
-- Resolved lazily and re-asked until it answers, the way
-- dev/src/compat_voxel.lua reaches its own neighbour: mod:find is nil until
-- the other mod has run, and load order between two mods is not ours to pin.
