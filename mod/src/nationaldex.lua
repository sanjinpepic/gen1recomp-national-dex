-- National dex wiring: species data beyond the 151 the ROM describes, the
-- modern type chart that data's typing needs, and the dex-page text for the
-- new species.
--
-- Engine seams this module drives (gen1recomp src/mods/Schemas.lua):
--   * mod.content.type_chart:register(id, value) -- bare type ids are
--     records {name, category}; "ATTACKER>DEFENDER" ids are matchup rows
--     with an x10 multiplier.  The engine registers the Gen 1 chart itself
--     (src/battle/TypeChart.lua); this module only ever registers the
--     modern chart, because national-dex typing is Gen 6+ -- DARK/STEEL/
--     FAIRY cannot exist on a Gen 1 chart, and species types are validated
--     against the merged chart.
--   * mod.content.text:register(id, str) -- dex-page description text, read
--     back at game.data.text[dexEntry.text] (src/ui/DexEntryMenu.lua:115).
--   * mod.content.pokemon:register / :patch -- beyond-151 species register
--     in full; the existing 151 species are patched with their modern
--     typing only, leaving their ROM art, learnsets and dex text untouched.
--     national.register ALSO carries the 326 alternate-form species (megas,
--     gigantamax, regional variants, ...) build_national_dex.py emits
--     alongside the 874 beyond-151 species -- a form is just another
--     pokemon record in the same table, with two extra fields (`form`,
--     `baseSpecies`) the schema's :register validator passes through
--     untouched (game/src/mods/Schemas.lua, Schemas.check's spec.fields
--     branch: unknown top-level keys are only rejected when they look like
--     a typo of a real field).  A form is NEVER a new Pokedex list row --
--     see the dexSize computation below for why registering it can't
--     accidentally grow the list past the true 1025.
--   * mod.content.constants:patch -- dexSize/dexDigits, so the dex list
--     (src/ui/PokedexMenu.lua iterates 1..dexSize) and the entry-page
--     number width grow with the roster.
--
-- The registered `learnset`/`level1Moves` reference only engine-known move
-- ids (the build tool filters against the engine's generated move table) --
-- that stays true, this engine still cannot execute a move it never
-- registered.  Every record additionally carries the complete modern data
-- unfiltered: `movesFull` (the full level-up learnset, including levels this
-- engine's move table cannot resolve), `movesByMethod` (machine/egg/tutor/
-- other), `abilities`, `evYield`, `eggGroups`, `baseHappiness`,
-- `growthRateName`, `genderRate` -- passthrough extra fields the same way
-- `form`/`baseSpecies`/`spAttack`/`spDefense` already are, for a dex page or
-- a Showdown-style battle engine built on top of this mod to read.  Beyond-
-- 151 species (and every form) share a shipped placeholder pic
-- (assets/sets/placeholder/*.png): battle loads spriteFront/Back with
-- love.graphics.newImage, which throws on a missing file, so those paths
-- must always exist.
--
-- Every registration is individually guarded: one bad record must never
-- fail the whole mod load.

-- The build tool emits sprite paths relative to the mod, because the install
-- location is only known at runtime.  Nothing anchors them for us: a species
-- record's art goes out through Sprites.path, and Assets.resolve rewrites
-- only paths under the engine's generated-assets prefix, so a bare
-- "assets/..." path is looked up at the *game* root and love throws
-- "Could not open file" the moment the species enters battle.  (Spelling
-- that prefix out here would trip modkit's MK301 ROM-content gate, which
-- matches the literal substring anywhere in a .lua body.)
-- mod.assets:path is the engine's sanctioned anchor
-- (Loader.lua: mod.path .. "/" .. relative).  Idempotent, so a payload that
-- already ships anchored paths passes through untouched.

-- Two measurements the generated payload spells in its own dialect rather

-- -- the entry page prints neither for one merely seen -- which is how they

--
-- `heightM` is read by that page as "this record measures in metres", and it
-- answers with the German GR./GEW. rows and a decimal comma
-- (src/ui/DexEntryMenu.lua:107-113).  There is no seam meaning "metric" in
-- any other language, and nothing in the engine's own import sets the field
-- at all, so every species this mod adds gave its size in German beside 151
-- Kanto species giving feet and pounds.  The metric pair is dropped rather
-- than translated: the imperial pair beside it is the same measurement and is
-- the one the page is built to print.
--
-- `weight` is TENTHS of a pound to the engine -- Snorlax is 10140 and the
-- page divides by ten before drawing it -- while the payload carries whole
-- pounds, so every species this mod adds weighed a tenth of what it should.
-- Folded here so one unit holds across both games; Gold's entry screen reads

-- The entry page draws a description one screen row per line break and wraps

-- mod's prose arrives as one flowing sentence -- tools/build_national_dex.py
-- collapses the source's own breaks, which were measured for a different
-- screen -- and so was drawn as a single line starting at the left margin and
-- running off the right edge, with about a fifth of it on the screen.  That
-- is only visible for a species the player OWNS, because the page prints no
-- description at all for one merely seen.
--
-- Broken here, at registration, rather than in the generated data, for the
-- reason the display casing is: this page belongs to the engine and neither
-- this mod nor any other patches it, so the data it is handed is the only
-- place a fix can live.

-- 132).  The cart's own entries never exceed 18 because they were written to
-- fit, which is not the same as 19 not fitting: taking the last column back
-- carries 75 more of the 1025 entries inside the page.
--
-- Prose that needs more than that ends in the font's own ellipsis, so a cut
-- reads as a cut rather than as a sentence that simply stops.
