-- View modes for the Gen 1 Pokédex LISTING: the engine's own numerical order,
-- alphabetical, and the species this save has actually recorded.  SELECT
-- cycles them and the mode is named on the title row beside POKéDEX.  START
-- opens the search (src/dexsearchview.lua).
--
-- With the national dex on, that screen is 1025 rows ordered by a number a
-- player mostly does not know.  Every other way into a species is by NAME --
-- the party, a trade, a conversation about one -- so a list that can only be
-- entered by its number is a list that has to be walked.
--
-- WHICH KEY.  The engine's list reads UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, A and B, plus
-- SELECT only when someone has set `onSelectKey` on it, which
-- src/ui/PokedexMenu.lua does not (src/ui/ListMenu.lua:137-179), so SELECT and
-- START are both free here.
--
-- The modes originally took START and the SEARCH took SELECT.  They swapped,
-- because the search is the feature that has to answer to ONE key across both
-- games: Gold's #DEX opens its own search with START
-- (src/ui/gen2/PokedexMenu.lua:383) and cannot be moved off it without losing
-- the cart's OPTION key, and on a desktop keyboard START is Escape while
-- SELECT is Tab -- so leaving Gen 1 on SELECT meant the same feature opening
-- with a different key depending on which game had booted.
--
-- The swap costs these modes the safer key and is still the right way round.
-- useful_dex 1.3.0 binds onSelectKey on this very list, so SELECT is the
-- contested one -- and a view mode that goes quiet next to a neighbour is a
-- convenience lost, while a search that did the same would be a feature simply
-- absent for those players.  Nothing binds START on this screen, so the search
-- works whatever else is installed.
--
-- The one thing that cannot be shared is WHO OWNS THE ROW ORDER.  A neighbour
-- that binds SELECT on this list is switching views of its own, and two owners
-- of one item array cannot both be right, so this stands down out loud when it
-- finds one (see the first-update check in `augment`) rather than fighting for
-- a screen it does not need to own.
--
-- Everything above M.apply is pure -- no love, no engine module, no mod handle
-- -- so the ordering, the filter and the cursor arithmetic are driven by tests
-- with plain tables.
--
-- A "row" here is one line of the listing: { dex = number, name = string,
-- known = boolean }, one per dex number the engine drew, in the engine's own
-- order.  A FORM is not a row and never becomes one: build_national_dex.py
-- numbers the 326 of them far above the real roster and src/nationaldex.lua
-- keeps dexSize off those numbers on purpose (see its FORM_DEX_BASE comment),
-- so `for n = 1, dexSize` never reaches them.  They stay where a player finds
-- them, on the entry page under LEFT/RIGHT, and sorting the listing by name
-- cannot pull twenty-six Alcremies in between two species.

local M = {}

-- ------------------------------------------------------------- pure logic

-- The cycle, in order, and the tag drawn for each.  Numerical is first and is
-- what a list opens in: it is the order the engine builds, the order the
-- entry pages number by and the order every guide ever written uses, so a
-- player who never presses START sees the screen they saw before this mod.
M.MODES = { "num", "alpha", "seen" }

-- The tag names the KEY as well as the mode.  Which view you are in is the
-- half that stops alphabetical reading as a corrupted list, but a player who
-- arrived somewhere by accident also needs to know what gets them back, and
-- the title row has room for both: POKéDEX ends at cell 7 and the longest of
-- these ends at cell 18 of 20.
M.TAG = { num = "SELECT NUM", alpha = "SELECT A-Z", seen = "SELECT SEEN" }

-- The key a row sorts by.  Uppercased because the two halves of this list are
-- typed differently -- the cart's own 151 are "PIKACHU" and every species this
-- mod adds is "Chikorita" -- and a byte-wise sort would file all 874 newcomers
-- after all 151 natives and still call itself alphabetical.  ASCII-only by
-- design: string.upper leaves the multi-byte glyphs alone, so NIDORAN♀ and
-- NIDORAN♂ sort by their bytes, next to each other and always the same way

-- would make A-Z a second filter and there is already one of those.
