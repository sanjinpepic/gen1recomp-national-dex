-- The byteless-TM pipeline that closes the "machine route" slice of
-- national_dex_effectmodeled_test.lua's own gap: this mod's only route into
-- a learnset is level-up widening (src/moves.lua), and PokeAPI's own more
-- recent games moved a batch of effectModeled = true moves onto an egg,
-- tutor or machine route that pipeline does not model at all -- see that
-- test's own header for the full sixteen-move account. Of the three,
-- "machine" is the one with a real, proven mechanism on this engine: an item
-- carrying `machine = { kind, move, number }`, taught through the engine's
-- own game/src/inventory/ItemEffects.lua TM path -- dev/battle_forms_mod's
-- TM171 for Tera Blast is the working precedent this file generalises.
-- Tutor has no engine mechanism at all (nothing under game/src implements a
-- move-tutor NPC or menu), and the one stranded move with an egg bucket
-- (Heart Stamp, on Miltank) already has other, better routes than a Day
-- Care visit -- both stay named in KNOWN_UNREACHABLE rather than half-built
-- here. tools/build_moves.py's own module docstring has the complete
-- accounting.
--
-- data/moves/generated/machine_teach.lua (built by tools/build_moves.py's
-- select_machine_tm_candidates/assign_tm_numbers) supplies the roster: one
-- row per invented TM, `{ item, move, number, species }`. This file's own
-- job is three plain registrations per row -- the item, the tmhm patches,
-- the mart listing -- and nothing about WHICH moves get one: that decision
-- is the builder's, recomputed from the live PokeAPI cache on every rebuild,
-- which is what keeps this a general pipeline rather than a hand-picked list.
--
-- EVERY ITEM HERE IS BYTELESS ON PURPOSE. `index` is never set. Gen 1 items
-- are one save byte each, 98-233 is packed solid, and 234-255 is down to
-- three free (234-251 taken by dev/battle_forms_mod's Drives and Crystals,
-- 252 by its own TM171 -- see that mod's data/drives.lua for the full
-- accounting). This pipeline is general precisely because it does not ask
-- "which handful of these moves can we afford a byte for" -- it follows
-- dev/battle_forms_mod/data/plates.lua's own precedent instead:
-- game/src/inventory/Bag.lua keys save.inventory BY ITEM ID, never by byte
-- (`for id in pairs(save.inventory)`), so a byteless item still buys, holds
-- and teaches on this engine's own save exactly like a real one. The one
-- thing it cannot survive is a round trip through a real Game Boy .sav
-- export (game/src/save_convert/GenSave.lua indexes purely by numeric
-- `index`), which nothing this pipeline invents needs to.
--
-- GATED ON `widen` -- the MOVES=ALL option, the same gate src/moves.lua's own
-- learnset widening runs under. src/moves.lua's header states the promise
-- plainly: GEN-NATIVE (the default) leaves every learnset byte-identical to
-- a build without the option. A tmhm entry is exactly that kind of change,
-- so under GEN-NATIVE this file registers nothing at all -- not even a
-- dangling item nobody can use yet.
