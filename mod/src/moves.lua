-- Modern moves: the 833-move roster as engine `moves` records, and the
-- optional widening of species learnsets onto the part of that roster this
-- engine can actually execute.
--
-- Two jobs, and the split between them is the whole safety argument:
--
--   REGISTRATION is unconditional and covers every move.  A move nothing can
--   learn is inert, so registering all of them costs a player nothing -- and
--   it is what makes the MOVES option safe to turn off again.
--   src/core/SaveData.lua strips any move id from a saved party that
--   data.moves does not hold, so a roster that appears only while the option
--   is on would delete moves off a player's team the moment they turned it
--   back off.  The ids are always there instead.
--
--   LEARNSET WIDENING is what the MOVES option gates, and it is filtered:
--   only a move whose `effectModeled` is true may ever reach a learnset.  A
--   blocked move is registered carrying the generation's most inert effect
--   (plain damage) and `effectModeled = false`, which is a PLACEHOLDER, not
--   an implementation -- so the filter below is the only thing standing
--   between that placeholder and a player's party.  Do not add a second path
--   into a learnset that does not go through allowedMove().
--
-- Which effect each move gets, and which ones are blocked, is decided at
-- build time by tools/build_moves.py -- see that file's module docstring for
-- the two-pass curation and why PokeAPI's own metadata cannot be trusted on
-- its own.  Nothing here re-derives it.
--
-- ONE PLACE WHERE "INERT" WAS NOT LITERALLY TRUE, and it is Gen 2 only:
-- Gold's Metronome builds its pool by walking data.moves for every record
-- with a `power` field (src/battle/gen2/Battle.lua:679-688, Battle:moveOrder),
-- so a registered move can be CALLED without anything having learnt it -- and
-- every record this mod registers has a power, a status move carrying 0.  Red's
-- Metronome does not walk anything: src/battle/MoveEffects.lua:701-710 rolls
-- ctx.data.constants.moveOrder, the ROM's own ordered list, which this mod
-- never writes to.  So the reach is Gold's alone, and a rolled placeholder
-- would resolve as plain damage with the move's real type, power and accuracy.
--
-- installMetronomeFilter below closes that: it wraps Gold's own pool builder
-- and drops the records carrying `effectModeled = false`, leaving Metronome
-- rolling the cart's roster plus the curated part of this one.  Registration
-- stays unconditional, so the SaveData argument above is untouched.
